Unlike the direct routes to Ilocos and Pangasinan, trade with Pampanga often occurred through transit towns in what are now Nueva Ecija and Nueva Vizcaya, following major river systems. This route highlights the broader geographic and economic connections of the Igorot trade network.","""From Asingan the Igorot land begins... to the East they continue with a cordillera of mountains that passes through the Caraballo, Santor, Gapán and reaches to the town of San Mateo, near the city of Manila"" (Antolín, 1789 Page 40 (Chapter 1). This situates Pampanga (via Gapan) as a geographic reference point, not a trade partner"").","Antolín's text is the main source, describing the geographic relationship between the Igorot lands and ""Upper Pampanga"" (modern Nueva Ecija). His accounts of trade in towns like Dupax and Bayombong, and the finding of unique items like eagle-stones, help piece together this corridor. Scott's works provide additional context on the political landscape of this region","The analysis of the Pampanga transit corridor shows that trade did not follow a direct route to Pampanga proper but moved through the foothills and river valleys of the vast province. Key areas included the mountains of Carranglan and Pantabangan in Nueva Ecija, where Antolín documented the finding of eagle-stones. Trade also flowed through the mission towns of Ituy along the Magat River, such as Dupax and Bayombong in Nueva Vizcaya, where transactions for slaves and other goods were recorded. The Igorots traded commodities like copper, gold, and slaves in these areas, obtaining cattle, cotton blankets, G-strings, and crude iron tools from the lowland communities in this transit corridor.","Putting the evidence together, the Pampanga corridor was a network of trails connecting the Igorot highlands to the eastern lowlands via the Magat and other river systems. This route was less a single path and more a zone of interaction, involving trade with communities in Nueva Vizcaya and Nueva Ecija that were under the political jurisdiction of Pampanga. This indirectness may have served as another layer of buffering and controlling contact with the colonial center in Manila.","In conclusion, the eastern trade toward Pampanga was characterized by its indirect nature, utilizing transit corridors through the Caraballo Sur mountains. This route facilitated essential exchange while allowing the Igorots to maintain their distance from the core of Spanish power, demonstrating the adaptability and strategic depth of their trade and resistance practices","Antolin, F.

Olivia Habana's research further identifies the Antamok mines (in Boa) and the Acupan mines as key sources of gold that supplied this southern trade","The analysis of the southern route to Pangasinan starts from the Polac/Boa region, the gold-rich heartland of Igorotland near modern Baguio. Traders would pass through towns on the route such as Ambuklao in Benguet, which served as a noted stopover and grazing area. The Boa area, part of the Baguio gold belt and home to the Antamok mines, was a central mining center that supplied the trade. The route ended at key lowland partners like San Carlos in Pangasinan, where Igorots traded directly for sustenance goods. The commodities exchanged by the Igorots were similar to the Ilocos route, including gold and copper, which were bartered for lowland products such as livestock, salt, rice, dried fish, and molasses from Pangasinan.","The analysis shows the Mt. Polac to Pangasinan route involved descending from the central cordillera through towns like Ambuklao, from the mining areas of Boa and Acupan, to the Pangasinan plains. This route was crucial for acquiring bulk sustenance goods and livestock. The trade was direct and economically vital for both highlanders and lowlanders, yet it was similarly protected by the Igorots, who controlled the flow of people and information along these mountain paths as a form of resistance.","The southern trade route to Pangasinan was an essential economic lifeLINE. It allowed for the exchange of the Igorots' mineral wealth for the agricultural and manufactured products of the lowlands, all while being managed with strategic discretion to preserve their independence.","Antolin, F.

Polac (modern Pulag) to the Ilocos coast. Based on Antolín's ""Notices,"" this corridor was vital for the exchange of highland minerals and goods for lowland manufactured products, particularly Ilocano textiles. The route was characterized by active commerce, but also by the Igorots' strategic secrecy and control over access to their trails.","Finally they reached the peak of the hills, where the Igorots have their main settlement, on account of the rich gold mines they enjoy there, and which they trade to the Ilocos and Pangasinán for things of sustenance, clothes and what else they need""((Antolín, 1789 Page 50 (Chapter 3). Antolín is quoting Father Francisco Colín's 17th-century history, confirming this trade route was long-established).","The primary source is Francisco Antolín's 1789 account, which details the journey from Tinoc to the Ilocos coast via Kabayan. William Henry Scott's works provide context on the political dynamics of this trade, while Olivia Habana's research on Benguet gold mining confirms the importance of sites like Acupan and the broader Pancutcutan area, which fed gold into this trade network.","The analysis of the route from Mt. Polac to Ilocos begins in the northern area of Tinoc in Ifugao, which Antolín identifies as a source of copper and slaves. Traders would then pass through Buguias in Benguet, a key trading point on the main trail network. The journey proceeded to Kabayan, Benguet, a major trading hub whose residents were noted for carrying the most gold to the lowlands. A critical and hazardous river crossing was located at Salipang, in the modern Kibungan or Bakun area, where an annual bridge was built. The route terminated at Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, the specified end point on the Ilocos coast where the trail from the mountains emerged. The primary commodities traded by the Igorots along this route included gold, copper, slaves, and handcrafted items, which they exchanged for lowland goods such as Ilocano textiles (blankets and G-strings), livestock, iron tools, salt, and glass beads.","Putting the evidence together, the Mt. Polac to Ilocos route was a well-established economic artery. The journey began in resource-rich northern areas like Tinoc, moved through central hubs like Buguias and the wealthy Kabayan, and navigated strategic chokepoints like the river crossing at Salipang. The relationship was ambivalent, mixing commerce for essential goods like blankets with raiding and a deep-seated mistrust that led the Igorots to guard these trails fiercely, often misleading or refusing passage to outsiders to maintain their autonomy.","In conclusion, the western trade route to Ilocos was a sophisticated network that allowed the Igorots to convert their mineral wealth into necessary lowland goods. However, this trade was conducted entirely on their terms, with deliberate secrecy and control over the routes serving as a primary strategy to resist Spanish encroachment.","Antolin, F. (1789).
