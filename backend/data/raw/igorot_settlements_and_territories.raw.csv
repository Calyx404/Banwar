Antolín (1789), Acupan was described as one of the richest sources of gold in the Cordillera. The site was widely known for its abundance, with its very name translated as ""to get gold with both hands"" Later accounts confirmed that Igorots extracted and traded gold with lowland communities, especially in Pangasinan and Ilocos (Scott, 1975).","The significance of Acupan lies in its role as a central mining hub. It contributed to the Igorots' self-sufficiency, allowed them to participate in wider trade networks, and reinforced their resistance against colonial control. The economic wealth from Acupan ensured that Igorots were not easily subdued by the Spanish.","Acupan represents not just a mining site but a cornerstone of Igorot livelihood and identity. When placed alongside other settlements like Kabayan and Buguias, Acupan highlights how mining and trade were essential for community survival and interregional exchange. Its presence demonstrates how Igorots strategically used natural resources to sustain autonomy while engaging with surrounding lowland groups.","In summary, Acupan exemplifies the Igorots' mastery of mining and their integration into regional trade networks. Its economic contributions shaped both the community's independence and its interactions with colonial and neighboring societies.","Antolín, F. (1789).
