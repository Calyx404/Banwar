When unpaid, they seized the land and launched ambuscades, raids, and burned towns, asserting control over frontier zones reaching toward the Cagayan coast. As Antolin noted, ""all the way to the seacoast of Cagayan are mountains populated by Tinguianes, Gaddanes, and other pagans of different tribes."" (Antolin, 1789, pp. 48-50).","Cagayan Valley's northeastern frontier, marked by the Sierra Madre and Cordillera ranges, was mapped by Spanish authorities as a launch point for missions and mining. Yet, as Antolin observed, ""no vein or gold mine has been discovered due to the resistance of the natives and the asperity… of those ranges and mountains… it cannot be expected that the said Tinguianes will give obedience or settle down."" (Antolin, 1789,pp. 167)."

Spanish control focused on coastal lowlands with ""missions established near the foothills"" and efforts of missionaries and alcaldes to govern these Christian towns. The coastal settlements were centers for ""the spread of Christianity and control of trade."" Clear geographical boundaries separated the Christian towns from the independent pagan mountains.

It was identified as a boundary region where the Spanish exerted colonial control over the lowlands, while the pagan tribes considered unconquered lands lay beyond in the mountains. (Antolin, 1789, pp. 198-200).","Although separated from the highland Igorots, Pampanga's proximity allowed it to serve as a base for expeditions. Its towns and missions were positioned near the frontier,providing troops and logistical support for campaigns into the mountains. (Antolin,1789,pp. 185-187, 192)."

The Igorots opposed missionaries' and governors' frequent attempts to establish direct roads across Pangasinan to the highlands, designating the region as a colonial frontier zone. (Antolin, 1789, pp. 211-216).","The Igorots relied heavily on Pangasinan as a trading partner. The Igorots bought animals, rice, and other items from Pangasinan and traded gold. Pangasinan was an essential link between the lowland markets and the mountain mines since trade routes traveled via towns like Asingan and San Nicolas. (Antolin, 1789, pp. 194, 230)."
