Mountains and Sacred Sites,icons/mountain.svg,POINT,[16.597500 120.899200],Mount Polac/Pulog,Mount Pulag,Benguet-Ifugao-Nueva Vizcaya,"""The highest is in the interior, visible from Dupax"" (Antolín, 1789, p. 10, para. 2).\n""Mount Pulog bears north-northwest from Dupax, that is, more to the north than to the west. In it the three principal rivers of the Igorots take their origin"" (Antolin, 1789, p.11, para. 2).\n""Site of a flood myth where one man and woman survived a deluge"" (Antolin, 1789, p.10, para.2).",Sacred Mountain / Cosmology,"Fray Francisco Antolín (1789) described ""Mount Polac"" as the highest mountain visible from Dupax, a sacred site with myths of survival from a great flood. Identifying Polac is significant, since it links geography with Igorot cultural traditions. Scholars debate whether Antolín meant modern Mount Pulag (highest in northern Luzon) or Mount Polis (linked to deluge myths).","Scholars(Scott, 1974)identify Polac with Mount Pulag. Some missionary sources links Mount Polac to Mount Polis  due to Flood Myths. A blend of Pulag's Geography and Polis's mythology.\n""The Ibaloy people of Benguet, who consider this mountain sacred, call it Polak, but it appears on modern maps as Mount Pulog, and at 2900 meters above sea level is the highest peak in northern Luzon"" (Antolin, 1789, p.315, sect. Notes, No.3)","William Henry Scott (1974) and subsequent historians identify Polac with Mount Pulag, citing its elevation, watershed role, and visibility. However, Antolín's deluge myth aligns more with oral traditions tied to Mount Polis in Ifugao and Bontoc. Missionary spellings varied—Polac, Pola, Pulog—reflecting Spanish phonetic transcription. State recognition later standardized the spelling as Pulag (Proclamation No. 75, 1987; RA 11685, 2022).","Antolín's geographic markers—its height, rivers, and Dupax visibility—correspond to Pulag's topography. Yet, the mythic narrative of a surviving man and woman fits Polis traditions. This duality suggests Antolín merged different Igorot accounts.",Polac thus represents a hybrid description: Pulag's physical geography and Polis's mythology. This reflects how colonial chroniclers often compiled fragmented indigenous traditions into a single narrative. The blending also illustrates Igorot cultural exchange across different mountain communities.,"Mount Polac can be best understood as Pulag geographically but carrying mythological elements of Polis. Antolín's account preserves both landscapes, showing how mountains functioned as cultural and spiritual anchors in Igorot cosmology.","Antolín, Francisco.

Mountains and Sacred Sites,icons/mountain.svg,POINT,[16.141389 120.808889],Mount Tapayac,"No present data can be found. (A mountain range near San Nicolas, Pangasinan)","Possible Caraballo range, east of San Nicolas, Pangasinan; ridge system overlooking Agno basin","""Above the town of Leabang there's a very high place on the mountain called Tapayac, and they pass through there from Ilocos to the mine of Pancutcutan…"" (Antolín, 1789/1988, p.99, Chapter 9).",Mountain range/ Frontier Landmark / Trade Corridor,"Antolín (1789) mentioned Mount Tapayac as a high point above Leabang, connected with Igorot settlements and trade routes. Its precise identification is debated, though it represents a culturally and strategically important mountain during the late 18th century.","Tapayac served as a major passage point along trans-Cordillera routes, linking Ilocos with Pancutcutan. In modern context, there is no valid information about this Mountain. So the plotted point is nothing more than assumption basing from Antolin's description","Tapayac is less referenced in modern literature compared to Pulag. Scholars note it appears in Antolín's descriptions as overlooking key Igorot frontiers. The name suggests a possible link with biblical references to 'tepeyac' or 'high places,' though localized meaning must be prioritized. Its connection with Leabang and Toboy River anchors its location within Nueva Vizcaya's uplands.","Based on Antolín's details, Tapayac lies above Leabang, requiring a five-hour trek along the Toboy River. This indicates a mountain near present-day Benguet-Nueva Vizcaya border. Its significance lies not only in elevation but also as a cultural marker tied to trade movement and community defense.","Tapayac represents how Antolín's accounts combine geography and narrative. It was not only a reference point for colonial mapping but also an Igorot stronghold, maintaining selective interaction with outsiders. As a symbol, Tapayac illustrates how mountains defined both territorial identity and spiritual imagination.","Though its exact modern equivalent is uncertain, Mount Tapayac highlights Antolín's ethnographic sensitivity to Igorot cultural landscapes. It stands as a testament to how mountains served as natural fortresses and sacred markers in colonial encounters.","Antolín, Francisco. Notices of the Pagan Igorots in the Interior of the Island.

Mountains and Sacred Sites,icons/mountain.svg,POINT,[16.319444 120.802500],Mount Maliongliong,"Probable modern name: Mount Ugo., (Mountain crest near Pancutcutan, possibly in today's Bokod-Itogon, Benguet area. Antolin, 1789/1988,p.99)","Likely a ridge in southern Benguet, near the headwaters of the Agno River","""…passing through the crest of Maliongliong, which is below Pancutcutan. In between these two points… the Agno River comes down  near San Nicolas"" (Antolín, 1789/1988, p.99, Chapter 9).",Mountain Range. Geographic Stronghold / Trail Network,"Mount Maliongliong, mentioned by Antolín (1789), remains an enigmatic reference among Cordillera mountains. Scholars propose it corresponds to modern Mount Ugo in the Benguet-Nueva Vizcaya borderlands. The debate highlights both the challenges and value of linking colonial texts with modern geography.","Maliongliong only mentioned once. Its mention as a crossing place shows the tactical and economic importance of such ridges in sustaining Igorot autonomy against Spanish expeditions. However, same as Mountain Tapayac, there is no present data that can justify its current location, only assumption.","Maliongliong appears sparsely in missionary records, but its placement matches routes described by Antolín connecting Benguet gold mines to Nueva Vizcaya. Modern researchers suggest a correlation with Mount Ugo, a site known for gold traces and a strategic location along trade corridors. Its mention reflects Spanish efforts to chart mining zones and local defenses.",The linguistic resemblance between 'Maliongliong' and oral recollections of mountains around Itogon and Kayapa strengthens its identification with Mount Ugo. Its role as a mining-linked highland aligns with Antolín's broader focus on Igorot mineral wealth and Spanish interest in controlling upland access routes.,"Identifying Maliongliong with Ugo illustrates how colonial transcription preserved distorted versions of indigenous place-names. Beyond geography, the site underscores the contested frontier where Spanish expeditions, Igorot miners, and trade networks converged. This blending of cultural, economic, and political narratives shows its thematic weight in Antolín's text.","Mount Maliongliong is most plausibly modern Mount Ugo. While not conclusive, the overlap of location, mining references, and trade functions supports this hypothesis. Its presence in Antolín's Noticias underLINEs the symbolic and economic centrality of Cordillera mountains in both Igorot tradition and colonial ambition.","Antolín, Francisco.
