        "present_day_location": "Itogon",
        "primary_description": "\"This place is called Acupan, which in their language means \"get gold with both hands together,\" and similarly denotes the abundance with which they collect gold in the rainy season, which is when more pagans gather there\" (Antolín, 1789, p. 85, para.4).",
        "thematic_value": "Mining & Economy: \"...,and that the one in Acupan was the most abundant and employed the most people working the gold\"; \"Travelling light, it is easily possible to get from the mission to the mines of Acupan in the space of three days despite zigzag ups and downs\" (Antolin, 1789, p.73, p.87)\"",
        "introduction": "Acupan, located in Itogon, Benguet, was one of the most prominent gold mining centers of the Igorots. Historically, it symbolized the economic strength and independence of the mountain communities.",
        "supporting_notes": "\"Known as one of the richest gold sources in Benguet. Antolín noted Igorots extracted gold from mines here, though often only seasonally, and used it for trade with Pangasinan and Ilocos\" (Antolín, 1789/1970, pp. 13-14; Scott, 1974, p. 89).<br>Later ethnographers also confirmed Acupan as a central Igorot mining zone (MGB-CAR, 2017).",
        "literature_review": "According to Fr. Antolín (1789), Acupan was described as one of the richest sources of gold in the Cordillera. The site was widely known for its abundance, with its very name translated as \"to get gold with both hands\" Later accounts confirmed that Igorots extracted and traded gold with lowland communities, especially in Pangasinan and Ilocos (Scott, 1975).",
        "analysis": "The significance of Acupan lies in its role as a central mining hub. It contributed to the Igorots' self-sufficiency, allowed them to participate in wider trade networks, and reinforced their resistance against colonial control. The economic wealth from Acupan ensured that Igorots were not easily subdued by the Spanish.",
        "discussion": "Acupan represents not just a mining site but a cornerstone of Igorot livelihood and identity. When placed alongside other settlements like Kabayan and Buguias, Acupan highlights how mining and trade were essential for community survival and interregional exchange. Its presence demonstrates how Igorots strategically used natural resources to sustain autonomy while engaging with surrounding lowland groups.",
        "conclusion": "In summary, Acupan exemplifies the Igorots' mastery of mining and their integration into regional trade networks. Its economic contributions shaped both the community's independence and its interactions with colonial and neighboring societies.",

And with this they passed on the next day to another little town nearby called Bokod of 38 houses, and from there they continued on their journey\" (Antolín, 1988, p.91).",
        "thematic_value": "Igorot stronghold;  \"...the very frontier of  the Igorots\" (Antolin, 1988, p.xii, p.91);",
        "introduction": "Ajanas, identified with modern-day Aritao in Nueva Vizcaya, served as a key Igorot stronghold and later as a Spanish frontier outpost. Its location made it a strategic site in the control of movement between lowland and highland communities.",
        "supporting_notes": "Identified as an Igorot defense stronghold near Aritao. Later became a frontier where Spaniards attempted to establish forts and missions. Symbolizes the contested space between Igorot independence and Spanish intrusion (Antolín, 1789/1970, p. 18; Scott, 1974, pp. 61-62).",
        "literature_review": "Fr. Antolín (1789) mentioned Ajanas as a defense stronghold of the Igorots, and Spanish missionaries later established it as part of their Ituy mission frontier. Historical accounts show that it was a contested borderland where resistance against Spanish advances was particularly strong.",
        "analysis": "Ajanas' value lies in its dual role as both a settlement and a frontier. For the Igorots, it was a defensive stronghold that secured trade and territorial boundaries. For the Spaniards, it was a strategic outpost for controlling upland populations and protecting their missions from Igorot incursions.",
        "discussion": "Ajanas illustrates how geography shaped conflict and interaction between the Igorots and Spaniards. It reflects the transformation of indigenous settlements into colonial frontier zones, emphasizing how resistance and adaptation coexisted in the same space. Its comparison with Dupax shows how frontier settlements functioned as points of negotiation and struggle.",
        "conclusion": "Ajanas highlights the Igorots' strategic use of territory to defend their autonomy. Later converted into a Spanish frontier, it stands as a symbol of cultural resistance, adaptation, and the complexities of colonization in upland-lowland borderlands.",

        "introduction": "The Amburayan Valley and River, spanning Ilocos Sur and La Union, served as a major route linking the Igorot highlands to the Ilocos lowlands.",
        "supporting_notes": "Antolín identifies the Amburayan as one of the rivers draining Igorot territory toward Ilocos; modern maps confirm Amburayan River flowing through Ilocos Sur and La Union (Antolín, 1789/1970, p. 23; Scott, 1974, p. 80).",
        "literature_review": "Historical sources note the Amburayan as a corridor that connected Tagudin in Ilocos with Igorot territories, allowing the transport of gold, rice, and other trade goods (Scott, 1975).",
        "analysis": "The Amburayan corridor functioned as both a cultural and economic link between highland and lowland communities, making it essential for trade and mobility.",
        "discussion": "Compared to frontier settlements like Dupax and Ajanas, the Amburayan highlights another form of contact zone—one centered on commerce rather than conflict. It was integral to sustaining Igorot trade networks with Ilocano communities.",
        "conclusion": "The Amburayan River demonstrates the importance of natural corridors in Igorot trade and interregional exchange, underlining the role of geography in cultural contact.",

        "discussion": "Though its location remains vague, Apayao adds to the pattern of Igorot reliance on mining across multiple provinces, showing resource-based resilience and autonomy.",

Notes, No.3)",
        "literature_review": "William Henry Scott (1974) and subsequent historians identify Polac with Mount Pulag, citing its elevation, watershed role, and visibility. However, Antolín's deluge myth aligns more with oral traditions tied to Mount Polis in Ifugao and Bontoc. Missionary spellings varied—Polac, Pola, Pulog—reflecting Spanish phonetic transcription.

        "supporting_notes": "Tapayac served as a major passage point along trans-Cordillera routes, linking Ilocos with Pancutcutan. In modern context, there is no valid information about this Mountain. So the plotted point is nothing more than assumption basing from Antolin's description",
        "literature_review": "Tapayac is less referenced in modern literature compared to Pulag. Scholars note it appears in Antolín's descriptions as overlooking key Igorot frontiers. The name suggests a possible link with biblical references to 'tepeyac' or 'high places,' though localized meaning must be prioritized. Its connection with Leabang and Toboy River anchors its location within Nueva Vizcaya's uplands.",
        "analysis": "Based on Antolín's details, Tapayac lies above Leabang, requiring a five-hour trek along the Toboy River. This indicates a mountain near present-day Benguet-Nueva Vizcaya border. Its significance lies not only in elevation but also as a cultural marker tied to trade movement and community defense.",
        "discussion": "Tapayac represents how Antolín's accounts combine geography and narrative. It was not only a reference point for colonial mapping but also an Igorot stronghold, maintaining selective interaction with outsiders. As a symbol, Tapayac illustrates how mountains defined both territorial identity and spiritual imagination.",
        "conclusion": "Though its exact modern equivalent is uncertain, Mount Tapayac highlights Antolín's ethnographic sensitivity to Igorot cultural landscapes. It stands as a testament to how mountains served as natural fortresses and sacred markers in colonial encounters.",

        "primary_description": "\"…passing through the crest of Maliongliong, which is below Pancutcutan. In between these two points… the Agno River comes down  near San Nicolas\" (Antolín, 1789/1988, p.99, Chapter 9).",
        "thematic_category": "Mountain Range. Geographic Stronghold / Trail Network",
        "introduction": "Mount Maliongliong, mentioned by Antolín (1789), remains an enigmatic reference among Cordillera mountains. Scholars propose it corresponds to modern Mount Ugo in the Benguet-Nueva Vizcaya borderlands. The debate highlights both the challenges and value of linking colonial texts with modern geography.",
        "supporting_notes": "Maliongliong only mentioned once. Its mention as a crossing place shows the tactical and economic importance of such ridges in sustaining Igorot autonomy against Spanish expeditions. However, same as Mountain Tapayac, there is no present data that can justify its current location, only assumption.",
        "literature_review": "Maliongliong appears sparsely in missionary records, but its placement matches routes described by Antolín connecting Benguet gold mines to Nueva Vizcaya. Modern researchers suggest a correlation with Mount Ugo, a site known for gold traces and a strategic location along trade corridors. Its mention reflects Spanish efforts to chart mining zones and local defenses.",
        "analysis": "The linguistic resemblance between 'Maliongliong' and oral recollections of mountains around Itogon and Kayapa strengthens its identification with Mount Ugo. Its role as a mining-linked highland aligns with Antolín's broader focus on Igorot mineral wealth and Spanish interest in controlling upland access routes.",
        "discussion": "Identifying Maliongliong with Ugo illustrates how colonial transcription preserved distorted versions of indigenous place-names. Beyond geography, the site underscores the contested frontier where Spanish expeditions, Igorot miners, and trade networks converged. This blending of cultural, economic, and political narratives shows its thematic weight in Antolín's text.",
        "conclusion": "Mount Maliongliong is most plausibly modern Mount Ugo. While not conclusive, the overlap of location, mining references, and trade functions supports this hypothesis. Its presence in Antolín's Noticias underLINEs the symbolic and economic centrality of Cordillera mountains in both Igorot tradition and colonial ambition.",

        "primary_description": "The Igorots once occupied slopes and savannahs near their mountains, charging Christian settlers land rent in rice and animals. When unpaid, they seized the land and launched ambuscades, raids, and burned towns, asserting control over frontier zones reaching toward the Cagayan coast. As Antolín noted, \"all the way to the seacoast of Cagayan are mountains populated by Tinguianes, Gaddanes, and other pagans of different tribes\" (Antolín, 1789, pp. 48-50).",
        "thematic_category": "Mountainous and valley terrain inhabited by various ethno-linguistic groups",
        "introduction": "Cagayan Valley is a mountainous region inhabited by Igorot tribes who strongly resisted Spanish attempts to control their territory. The region’s challenging terrain made it difficult for Spanish explorers to establish settlements or access gold mines. Antolín highlights the defensive tactics used by Igorots, including charging land rent and conducting raids against settlers (Antolín, 1789, pp. 48-50).",
        "supporting_notes": "Cagayan Valley’s northeastern frontier, marked by the Sierra Madre and Cordillera ranges, was mapped by Spanish authorities as a launch point for missions and mining. Yet, as Antolín observed, \"no vein or gold mine has been discovered due to the resistance of the natives and the asperity… of those ranges and mountains… it cannot be expected that the said Tinguianes will give obedience or settle down\" (Antolín, 1789, pp. 167).",
        "literature_review": "The Igorots in Cagayan Valley traded gold and other items with lowland Christian settlements, though they fiercely protected their land and autonomy. Spanish authorities mapped the area for mining and missions but faced indigenous opposition and geographical obstacles (Antolín, 1789, pp. 167, 230).",
        "analysis": "Polygonal map data reveals the valley’s natural barriers which limited colonial expansion. This spatial evidence aligns with Antolín’s descriptions of ambushes and native control that kept missionaries and miners at bay.",
        "discussion": "The mountains and rivers acted as natural defenses for the Igorots, underpinning their successful resistance. Spanish influence remained largely confined to foothills and coastal towns, failing to penetrate the highlands (Antolín, 1789, pp. 48-50, 167).",

        "introduction": "This section explores the more indirect eastern trade corridor toward the vast colonial province of Pampanga. Unlike the direct routes to Ilocos and Pangasinan, trade with Pampanga often occurred through transit towns in what are now Nueva Ecija and Nueva Vizcaya, following major river systems. This route highlights the broader geographic and economic connections of the Igorot trade network.",
        "supporting_notes": "\"From Asingan the Igorot land begins... to the East they continue with a cordillera of mountains that passes through the Caraballo, Santor, Gapán and reaches to the town of San Mateo, near the city of Manila\" (Antolín, 1789 Page 40 (Chapter 1). This situates Pampanga (via Gapan) as a geographic reference point, not a trade partner\").",
        "literature_review": "Antolín's text is the main source, describing the geographic relationship between the Igorot lands and \"Upper Pampanga\" (modern Nueva Ecija). His accounts of trade in towns like Dupax and Bayombong, and the finding of unique items like eagle-stones, help piece together this corridor. Scott's works provide additional context on the political landscape of this region",
        "analysis": "The analysis of the Pampanga transit corridor shows that trade did not follow a direct route to Pampanga proper but moved through the foothills and river valleys of the vast province. Key areas included the mountains of Carranglan and Pantabangan in Nueva Ecija, where Antolín documented the finding of eagle-stones. Trade also flowed through the mission towns of Ituy along the Magat River, such as Dupax and Bayombong in Nueva Vizcaya, where transactions for slaves and other goods were recorded. The Igorots traded commodities like copper, gold, and slaves in these areas, obtaining cattle, cotton blankets, G-strings, and crude iron tools from the lowland communities in this transit corridor.",
        "discussion": "Putting the evidence together, the Pampanga corridor was a network of trails connecting the Igorot highlands to the eastern lowlands via the Magat and other river systems. This route was less a single path and more a zone of interaction, involving trade with communities in Nueva Vizcaya and Nueva Ecija that were under the political jurisdiction of Pampanga. This indirectness may have served as another layer of buffering and controlling contact with the colonial center in Manila.",
        "conclusion": "In conclusion, the eastern trade toward Pampanga was characterized by its indirect nature, utilizing transit corridors through the Caraballo Sur mountains. This route facilitated essential exchange while allowing the Igorots to maintain their distance from the core of Spanish power, demonstrating the adaptability and strategic depth of their trade and resistance practices",

        "supporting_notes": "\"They sold their foodstuffs: two dried fish from Pangasinan for a half-real, two cakes of sugarcane sugar for a half-real, a ganta of cleaned rice for a real and a half..\" (Antolín, 1789 pg. 104 (Chapter 7). From a scout's report on the gold-washing site of Dapiag\").",
        "literature_review": "Antolín's \"Notices\" provides the foundational descriptions of this route, mentioning descent towards Pangasinan and specific waypoints like Ambuklao. Olivia Habana's research further identifies the Antamok mines (in Boa) and the Acupan mines as key sources of gold that supplied this southern trade",
        "analysis": "The analysis of the southern route to Pangasinan starts from the Polac/Boa region, the gold-rich heartland of Igorotland near modern Baguio. Traders would pass through towns on the route such as Ambuklao in Benguet, which served as a noted stopover and grazing area. The Boa area, part of the Baguio gold belt and home to the Antamok mines, was a central mining center that supplied the trade. The route ended at key lowland partners like San Carlos in Pangasinan, where Igorots traded directly for sustenance goods. The commodities exchanged by the Igorots were similar to the Ilocos route, including gold and copper, which were bartered for lowland products such as livestock, salt, rice, dried fish, and molasses from Pangasinan.",
        "discussion": "The analysis shows the Mt. Polac to Pangasinan route involved descending from the central cordillera through towns like Ambuklao, from the mining areas of Boa and Acupan, to the Pangasinan plains. This route was crucial for acquiring bulk sustenance goods and livestock. The trade was direct and economically vital for both highlanders and lowlanders, yet it was similarly protected by the Igorots, who controlled the flow of people and information along these mountain paths as a form of resistance.",
        "conclusion": "The southern trade route to Pangasinan was an essential economic lifeLINE. It allowed for the exchange of the Igorots' mineral wealth for the agricultural and manufactured products of the lowlands, all while being managed with strategic discretion to preserve their independence.",

        "introduction": "This section reconstructs the western trade route connecting the Igorot gold mining heartland around Mt. Polac (modern Pulag) to the Ilocos coast. Based on Antolín's \"Notices,\" this corridor was vital for the exchange of highland minerals and goods for lowland manufactured products, particularly Ilocano textiles. The route was characterized by active commerce, but also by the Igorots' strategic secrecy and control over access to their trails.",
        "supporting_notes": "Finally they reached the peak of the hills, where the Igorots have their main settlement, on account of the rich gold mines they enjoy there, and which they trade to the Ilocos and Pangasinán for things of sustenance, clothes and what else they need\"((Antolín, 1789 Page 50 (Chapter 3). Antolín is quoting Father Francisco Colín's 17th-century history, confirming this trade route was long-established).",
        "literature_review": "The primary source is Francisco Antolín's 1789 account, which details the journey from Tinoc to the Ilocos coast via Kabayan. William Henry Scott's works provide context on the political dynamics of this trade, while Olivia Habana's research on Benguet gold mining confirms the importance of sites like Acupan and the broader Pancutcutan area, which fed gold into this trade network.",
        "analysis": "The analysis of the route from Mt. Polac to Ilocos begins in the northern area of Tinoc in Ifugao, which Antolín identifies as a source of copper and slaves. Traders would then pass through Buguias in Benguet, a key trading point on the main trail network. The journey proceeded to Kabayan, Benguet, a major trading hub whose residents were noted for carrying the most gold to the lowlands. A critical and hazardous river crossing was located at Salipang, in the modern Kibungan or Bakun area, where an annual bridge was built. The route terminated at Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, the specified end point on the Ilocos coast where the trail from the mountains emerged. The primary commodities traded by the Igorots along this route included gold, copper, slaves, and handcrafted items, which they exchanged for lowland goods such as Ilocano textiles (blankets and G-strings), livestock, iron tools, salt, and glass beads.",
        "discussion": "Putting the evidence together, the Mt. Polac to Ilocos route was a well-established economic artery. The journey began in resource-rich northern areas like Tinoc, moved through central hubs like Buguias and the wealthy Kabayan, and navigated strategic chokepoints like the river crossing at Salipang. The relationship was ambivalent, mixing commerce for essential goods like blankets with raiding and a deep-seated mistrust that led the Igorots to guard these trails fiercely, often misleading or refusing passage to outsiders to maintain their autonomy.",
        "conclusion": "In conclusion, the western trade route to Ilocos was a sophisticated network that allowed the Igorots to convert their mineral wealth into necessary lowland goods. However, this trade was conducted entirely on their terms, with deliberate secrecy and control over the routes serving as a primary strategy to resist Spanish encroachment.",
