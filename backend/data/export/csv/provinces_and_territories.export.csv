When unpaid, they seized the land and launched ambuscades, raids, and burned towns, asserting control over frontier zones reaching toward the Cagayan coast. As Antolín noted, ""all the way to the seacoast of Cagayan are mountains populated by Tinguianes, Gaddanes, and other pagans of different tribes"" (Antolín, 1789, pp. 48-50).",Mountainous and valley terrain inhabited by various ethno-linguistic groups,"Cagayan Valley is a mountainous region inhabited by Igorot tribes who strongly resisted Spanish attempts to control their territory. The region’s challenging terrain made it difficult for Spanish explorers to establish settlements or access gold mines. Antolín highlights the defensive tactics used by Igorots, including charging land rent and conducting raids against settlers (Antolín, 1789, pp. 48-50).","Cagayan Valley’s northeastern frontier, marked by the Sierra Madre and Cordillera ranges, was mapped by Spanish authorities as a launch point for missions and mining. Yet, as Antolín observed, ""no vein or gold mine has been discovered due to the resistance of the natives and the asperity… of those ranges and mountains… it cannot be expected that the said Tinguianes will give obedience or settle down"" (Antolín, 1789, pp. 167).","The Igorots in Cagayan Valley traded gold and other items with lowland Christian settlements, though they fiercely protected their land and autonomy. Spanish authorities mapped the area for mining and missions but faced indigenous opposition and geographical obstacles (Antolín, 1789, pp. 167, 230).",Polygonal map data reveals the valley’s natural barriers which limited colonial expansion. This spatial evidence aligns with Antolín’s descriptions of ambushes and native control that kept missionaries and miners at bay.,"The mountains and rivers acted as natural defenses for the Igorots, underpinning their successful resistance. Spanish influence remained largely confined to foothills and coastal towns, failing to penetrate the highlands (Antolín, 1789, pp. 48-50, 167).","In Cagayan Valley, geography and indigenous resilience combined to maintain Igorot control over key areas, limiting Spanish colonial reach (Antolín, 1789).","Antolín, F.

Spanish settlements functioned as bases for expeditions into mountainous indigenous areas (Antolín, 1789, pp. 185-187).","Although separated from the highland Igorots, Pampanga’s proximity allowed it to serve as a base for expeditions. Its towns and missions were positioned near the frontier,providing troops and logistical support for campaigns into the mountains(Antolin,1789,pp. 185-187, 192).","The Spanish towns provided military and logistical support for campaigns against Igorot territories.

It was a colonial frontier with contested access (Antolín, 1789).","The Igorots relied heavily on Pangasinan as a trading partner. The Igorots bought animals, rice, and other items from Pangasinan and traded gold. Pangasinan was an essential link between the lowland markets and the mountain mines since trade routes traveled via towns like Asingan and San Nicolas (Antolín, 1789, pp. 194, 230).","Antolín notes that Igorots resisted colonial attempts to build roads through the mountains, protecting their territories. Despite this, trade routes between lowland towns and mountain markets were active (Antolín, 1789, pp. 211-216).","Polygons outline mixed terrain that supported trade but limited Spanish control over mountainous areas, confirming Antolín’s observations.","Pangasinan was a dynamic frontier where commerce and indigenous resistance coexisted.
