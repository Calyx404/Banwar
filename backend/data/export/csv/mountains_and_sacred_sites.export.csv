1,Mount Polac/Pulog,Mount Pulag,MOUNTAINS AND SACRED SITES,POINT,"[120.8992, 16.5975]",Benguet-Ifugao-Nueva Vizcaya,Benguet-Ifugao-Nueva Vizcaya,"""The highest is in the interior, visible from Dupax."" (Antolin, 1789, p. 10, para. 2). <br>""Mount Pulog bears north-northwest from Dupax, that is, more to the north than to the west. In it the three principal rivers of the Igorots take their origin."" (Antolin, 1789, p.11, para. 2). <br>Site of a flood myth where one man and woman survived a deluge. (Antolin, 1789, p.10, para.2).","Scholars(Scott, 1974) identify Polac with Mount Pulag. Some missionary sources links Mount Polac to Mount Polis  due to Flood Myths. A blend of Pulag's Geography and Polis's mythology. <br>""The Ibaloy people of Benguet, who consider this mountain sacred, call it Polak, but it appears on modern maps as Mount Pulog, and at 2900 meters above sea level is the highest peak in northern Luzon."" (Antolin, 1789, p.315, sect. Notes, No.3)."
2,Mount Tapayac,No present data can be found.,MOUNTAINS AND SACRED SITES,POINT,"[120.8088, 16.1413]","Possible.. Caraballo range, east of San Nicolas, Pangasinan; ridge system overlooking Agno basin",Mountain range/ Frontier Landmark / Trade Corridor,"""Above the town of Leabang there's a very high place on the mountain called Tapayac, and they pass through there from Ilocos to the mine of Pancutcutan…"" (Antolin, 1789/1988, p.99, Chapter 9).","Tapayac served as a major passage point along trans-Cordillera routes, linking Ilocos with Pancutcutan. In modern context, there is no valid information about this Mountain. So the plotted point is nothing more than assumption basing from Antolin's description."
3,Mount Maliongliong,"Probable Modern name: Mount Ugo. <br>(Mountain crest near Pancutcutan, possibly in today's Bokod-Itogon, Benguet area. Antolin, 1789/1988,p.99)",MOUNTAINS AND SACRED SITES,POINT,"[120.8025, 16.3194]","Likely a ridge in southern Benguet, near the headwaters of the Agno River",Mountain Range. Geographic Stronghold / Trail Network,"…passing through the crest of Maliongliong, which is below Pancutcutan. In between these two points… the Agno River comes down  near San Nicolas."" (Antolin, 1789/1988, p.99, Chapter 9).","Maliongliong only mentioned once. Its mention as a crossing place shows the tactical and economic importance of such ridges in sustaining Igorot autonomy against Spanish expeditions. However, same as Mountain Tapayac, there is no present data that can justify its current location, only assumption."
